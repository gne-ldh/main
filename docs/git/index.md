## Effective collaboration and version control with Git and GithHub

## Course Description

This Git and GitHub course is hands-on, “learning by doing” course, encouraging you to explore and solve problem yourself.

You will learn to effectively collaborate and still keep track of who did what and having full control on the content / code.

You will learn how to create a place where all members of your team will contribute to single project. Need to work on copies rather than original, and thus knowing forking, cloning, adding content, editing content, commits, branches, stash, cherry picking, rebasing, pull requests and lot more to make you professional.

## Course Overview

No matter if you're a content writer (solo or collaborating), writing technical papers or   just getting started with (web) development, if you're applying for a developer job or if you need to refresh your knowledge - version control is a core skill you need to develop as a developer. As needed to be successful! Git (a version control system) and Github (a cloud provider for Git managed projects) make an excellent combination to provide the best possible experience for creating and maintaining a clearly structured project history!
